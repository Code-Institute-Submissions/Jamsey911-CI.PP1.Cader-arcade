## Design

### Design Choices
This project has been created out of my love for video games and wish for something when i was younger for a local arcade to have live inhouse tournaments where i could socialise with fellow gamers. 

My goal is to create a welcoming yet efficent website so people of all ages feel at ease while they navigate through the content. In order to achieve this, all relevant content is made easy to read in the index with links to the sign up page for any upcoming events that are taking place another seperate page to book for a party(Birthday, confirmation, christmas) and another page with all relevant contact information.

### Colour
 The colour sheme was chosen as a dark red and dark blue theme, and was also aided by colorhexa in which a Split Complementary Color was selected. A light grey and soft yellow was used to give it contrast which was selected through adobe color. A slighly soft red was selected for certain alerts in the events page.

### Fonts
Libre Baskerville was used for the logo and main headings. 
<br>
Libre Franklin was used for the sub-heading and smaller body elements. 
<br>
The fonts were chosen because the Libre Baskerville matched some of the illustraitions in the arcade and match for this font was made through fontjoy.
<br>
San-serif was used as my backup.

### Structure
The page is structured in a well know, recognizable, user friendly, and easy to learn way. Upon arriving to the website the user sees a familiar type of navigation bar with the restaurant logo on the left side and the navigation links to the right. 
The website consists of five separate pages: 
- A homepage with a sections for News and Sunday Meal Offers
- An about page with the About Us and Meet the Chef
- A menu page
- A image gallery with images and video showcasing the general feel of the restaurant
- A contact page with a contact form, a map and information about the bussines section
